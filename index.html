          <h3>Welcome to the Blackport project.</h3>

<p>This project Allows users with parental responsibility's over Children to distribute the responsibilities of a household to their children. The system aims to allow said users' the ability to create chores/tasks to be performed by the dependent user (child/teenager), to earn rewards. The Project will also provide the dependent user with a means to manage their own income, in a simple way, and spend the income via request to the parental user to make automated purchases via third party services, such as- iTunes, Microsoft Store, Microsoft Points, Amazon, Netflix etc...:</p>
